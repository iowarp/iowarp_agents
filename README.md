## Usage

Once installed, agents are automatically available in Claude Code:

```
/agents
```

Or use natural language:
- "Use the data-io-expert to help me convert this HDF5 file"
- "I need the hpc-performance-expert to optimize my SLURM job"

## Integration with IOWarp MCPs

These agents work seamlessly with [IOWarp MCPs](https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-mcps):

```bash
# Install MCPs for enhanced agent capabilities
uvx iowarp-mcps pandas  # Used by analysis-viz-expert
uvx iowarp-mcps slurm   # Used by hpc-performance-expert
```
